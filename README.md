# PythonLibraryInventoryManagement
A tool demonstrating OOP in the case of multiple libraries and books.

This showcases the following:
--Object Oriented Programming. I use multiple classes to represent real world objects - books and libraries.
--Demonstration of loops - both for and while when most relevant.
--Understanding of reusability and component based programming. For repetitive blocks of code, I call functions to prevent writing unneccessary lines.
--Features above and beyond the usual scope the client would expect. For example, when searching for if a book by a specific author exists, if none are found, it will suggest any others by that author / of that name in case you mistyped.
--Error handling - by sanitising inputs, I handle situations that could cause errors and break the program.
--Edge cases. I have added in measures for every edge case I could think of, including custom messages for when there are no search results found, the user tries to move books from one library to the same library etc.
--Lambda functions - a couple of small examples of lambda functions just to showcase using them.
--Positive user design - to improve UX, I add in the options to back out of most of the menus and I treat all inputs as case-insensitive.
